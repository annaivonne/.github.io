        <h3>Teaching Philosophy and Course Development Plan</h3>
        <p>I received systematic English-language accounting training at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics' U.S. Accounting Program (Elite Class), and also participate in summer school classes with English as class language. Meanwhile, I went to UTD for exchange as a visiting scholar for a full year and visited University of Pennsylvania, gaining proficiency in English communication. My experience and training enables me to teach fully in English. As a TA for Professor Chen Xinyuan's Advanced Financial Accounting and Tax Law courses, I have honed skills in lecture delivery, student interaction, and curriculum support. My extensive collaboration network also supports innovative teaching practices and enables me to learn from experieced lecturers.</p>
        
        <h4>(I) Teaching Philosophy</h4>
        <p><strong>Student-Centered Approach:</strong> As Karl Jasper pointed out, "Education is an awakening of one soul by another".  I prioritize student engagement through interactive methods, fostering compound finance talents by integrating intelligent accounting. Employ problem-oriented designs to deconstruct knowledge points, using industry cases to shape professional ethics. Cases like Luckin Coffee scandal, Enron, and Evergrande fraud reinforce legal and moral education, guiding students toward integrity and rule adherence.</p>
        <p>Adopt problem-based teaching to condense abstract content from multiple courses into 8 interconnected problems. Key principles:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Abandon "chalk-and-talk" mode; emphasize student agency with interactive elements like group discussions, case analyses, and presentations to build autonomy and critical thinking. For example, in Financial Accounting, use real enterprise cases for group analysis and classroom showcases, with instructor feedback.</li>
          <li>Cultivate practical and innovative skills: Integrate practice throughout, partnering with firms for internships and real-world application. Offer entrepreneurship courses and projects, e.g., guiding students in "Internet+" innovation contests for novel accounting solutions.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>(II) Characteristic Course Construction</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intelligent Accounting Course:</strong> Merge accounting with emerging tech for a comprehensive system covering financial robots, big data analysis, and smart shared services. Blend theory and practice; e.g., hands-on financial robot simulations for invoice recognition and accounting processing.</li>
          <li><strong>International Accounting Course:</strong> Align with global trends, covering IFRS, national regimes, and tax policies. Host expert lectures and international case studies to broaden horizons for multinational roles.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>(III) Path to Incubating First-Class Courses</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>University-Level First-Class Courses:</strong> Optimize syllabi, content, methods, and assessments. Build resources like high-quality slides and videos; infuse latest research (e.g., activity-based costing in new manufacturing). Apply for university recognition through reviews and defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Municipal-Level First-Class Courses:</strong> Elevate via inter-university collaborations and shared resources. Participate in competitions and awards; seek expert evaluations for continuous improvement. Leverage resources for regional demonstration, applying for municipal status to boost influence.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr />
        <h3>Professional Development</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Trained in bilingual teaching methodologies during U.S. Accounting Program at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (2016â€“2019).</li>
          <li>Participated in Fudan University teaching workshops on empirical methods and STATA for accounting education.</li>
